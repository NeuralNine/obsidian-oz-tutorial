# Summary

In May 2022, Nvidia made a significant shift in their approach to Linux support by releasing open-source GPU kernel modules for their data center and workstation GPUs. This move marked a major departure from the company's historically closed-source approach to driver development, which had been a long-standing point of contention with the Linux community.

The open-source kernel modules provide an alternative to Nvidia's proprietary drivers, particularly targeting data center environments where GPUs are used for compute workloads, AI training, and high-performance computing. The release was seen as a response to years of pressure from the Linux community and kernel developers who had criticized Nvidia's closed approach.

The move has implications for Linux distributions, which can now include Nvidia support more easily in their default installations. It also opens the door for kernel developers to better integrate Nvidia hardware support directly into the mainline Linux kernel, potentially improving performance, security, and compatibility.

While the initial release focused on newer GPU architectures and data center use cases, the community viewed this as a positive step toward broader open-source driver support. The decision aligns with trends seen from other hardware vendors who have embraced open-source drivers as the preferred method for Linux support.

## Key Points
- Nvidia released open-source kernel modules for Linux GPU support
- Primarily targets data center and workstation GPUs initially
- Represents a significant shift from Nvidia's historically closed-source approach
- Enables better integration with Linux kernel mainline
- Addresses long-standing community criticism of Nvidia's Linux support

## Relevance to open source
This release represents a major victory for the open-source community. Nvidia's GPUs are critical for AI/ML workloads and high-performance computing, and open-source drivers enable better Linux integration, security auditing, and community contributions. It demonstrates that even traditionally closed companies can embrace open source when there's sufficient community and market pressure.
