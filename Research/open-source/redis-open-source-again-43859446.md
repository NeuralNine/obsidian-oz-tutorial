# Summary

In May 2025, Redis announced its return to open source licensing by adopting the AGPLv3 license, reversing its controversial 2024 switch to the Server Side Public License (SSPL). The announcement came from Salvatore Sanfilippo (antirez), Redis's original creator who had rejoined the company five months earlier.

Antirez revealed that discussions about switching to AGPL had been ongoing within Redis even before he returned. His influence helped strengthen the pro-AGPL position within the company. He openly admitted that he wanted his new work on Vector Sets (a new Redis data type) to be released under a true open-source license, as writing open-source software is fundamental to his identity as a developer.

The blog post explains that the SSPL had failed to be accepted by the community - the OSI wouldn't recognize it as open source, and the broader software community didn't regard it as an open license. By contrast, AGPL is a well-established open-source license that addresses concerns about cloud providers using software without contributing back.

Redis 8, the first version under the new license, shipped simultaneously with the announcement. The return to open source was framed as necessary for Redis to be "coherent with the Redis project, to be accepted by the user base, and to contribute to a human collective effort that is larger than any single company."

## Key Points
- Redis switched from SSPL back to open source (AGPLv3)
- Antirez (original creator) rejoined and advocated for the change
- SSPL had failed to gain community acceptance
- Redis 8 released with the new license
- Move seen as necessary for community acceptance and project coherence

## Relevance to open source
This story demonstrates that community pressure and developer values can reverse corporate licensing decisions. The SSPL's rejection by the OSI and broader community ultimately made it untenable. Redis's return to AGPL shows that companies can find licensing models that address their business concerns while remaining genuinely open source.
