# Summary

In September 2022, OpenAI released Whisper, an open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. Unlike OpenAI's GPT models which remained proprietary, Whisper was released with full model weights and code under an MIT license.

Whisper represented a significant advancement in speech recognition technology, approaching human-level robustness and accuracy across many languages and accents. The model was trained to perform multiple tasks including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection.

The open-source release was notable because it came from OpenAI, a company that had increasingly moved toward closed-source releases for their most capable models. Whisper bucked this trend, providing the community with state-of-the-art speech recognition that could be run locally without requiring API access or ongoing subscription costs.

The impact of Whisper on the developer community has been substantial. It enabled a wave of applications including transcription services, accessibility tools, and voice interfaces. Projects like whisper.cpp made it possible to run Whisper efficiently on consumer hardware, and various optimized versions were created for different use cases. The release demonstrated that open-sourcing AI models can accelerate innovation across the entire ecosystem.

## Key Points
- OpenAI released Whisper as open-source under MIT license in September 2022
- Trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual speech data
- Supports transcription, translation, and language identification
- Approaches human-level accuracy for many languages
- Sparked ecosystem of tools like whisper.cpp for local inference

## Relevance to open source
Whisper's release showed that even companies moving toward closed models can still contribute significantly to open source. By releasing a state-of-the-art speech recognition system openly, OpenAI enabled countless applications and improvements that would not have been possible with a proprietary API-only approach. The project became a foundation for many downstream innovations in voice technology.
