# Summary

Docs is an open-source documentation and note-taking platform that serves as an alternative to commercial tools like Notion and Outline. The project gained significant attention on Hacker News in March 2025, demonstrating strong community interest in open-source productivity tools that respect user privacy and provide data ownership.

The platform is designed to provide similar functionality to Notion - including documents, databases, and collaborative features - while being fully self-hostable. This addresses concerns many users have about storing sensitive information in closed SaaS platforms where data is controlled by the service provider.

The open-source nature of Docs allows organizations to deploy it on their own infrastructure, ensuring full control over their data. It also enables customization and integration with existing workflows, something that closed platforms often restrict. The project is built with modern web technologies and designed for both individual and team use.

The strong reception on Hacker News reflects a broader trend in the developer community toward open-source alternatives for productivity software. Users increasingly value the ability to own their data, avoid vendor lock-in, and contribute to the tools they use daily.

## Key Points
