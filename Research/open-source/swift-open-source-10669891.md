# Summary

In December 2015, Apple announced that Swift, its modern programming language for iOS, macOS, and beyond, would be open-sourced. The announcement included the release of the Swift compiler, standard library, and core libraries under the Apache 2.0 license with a Runtime Library Exception.

This was a significant move for Apple, which had historically maintained tight control over its development tools and platforms. Swift had been introduced in 2014 as a modern replacement for Objective-C, and the decision to open-source it just a year later demonstrated Apple's recognition that an open ecosystem could accelerate the language's adoption and development.

The open-source release included not just the language itself but also the Swift Package Manager and plans for Linux support. This enabled Swift to be used for server-side development and other applications beyond Apple's platforms. The swift.org website became the home for the open-source project, with community governance and contribution guidelines.

The impact of open-sourcing Swift has been substantial. The language has seen contributions from developers worldwide, improving its performance, features, and cross-platform support. Server-side Swift frameworks emerged, and the language became viable for a broader range of applications than Apple's original mobile-focused use case.

## Key Points
- Apple open-sourced Swift in December 2015
- Released under Apache 2.0 license with Runtime Library Exception
- Included compiler, standard library, and package manager
- Enabled Linux support and server-side development
- swift.org established for community governance

## Relevance to open source
Apple's decision to open-source Swift demonstrated that even a company known for proprietary control could benefit from open development. The move expanded Swift's reach beyond Apple platforms and enabled a broader community to contribute to the language's evolution, ultimately making it more robust and widely adopted.
