# Summary

In November 2014, Microsoft made a historic announcement by open-sourcing the .NET framework and making it cross-platform. This decision marked a dramatic shift in Microsoft's corporate strategy under CEO Satya Nadella, moving away from the company's traditionally proprietary approach to software development.

The open-sourcing of .NET included the core runtime, framework libraries, and compiler. Microsoft released the code under permissive licenses and established the .NET Foundation to steward the project's development. The move enabled developers to run .NET applications on Linux and macOS, breaking the platform's historical Windows-only limitation.

This announcement was part of a broader transformation at Microsoft toward embracing open source. The company began contributing to open-source projects, acquiring GitHub, and becoming one of the largest corporate contributors to open-source software. The .NET decision signaled that Microsoft recognized the value of community-driven development and cross-platform compatibility.

The impact of this decision has been substantial. .NET Core (later unified as .NET 5+) became a popular choice for building cross-platform applications, microservices, and cloud-native software. The open-source approach attracted contributions from the community and improved the framework's quality, performance, and feature set.

## Key Points
- Microsoft open-sourced the .NET framework in November 2014
- Made .NET cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Released under permissive open-source licenses
- Established the .NET Foundation for governance
- Marked a major shift in Microsoft's corporate strategy toward open source

## Relevance to open source
This announcement was a watershed moment demonstrating that even the most proprietary software companies can embrace open source. Microsoft's transformation from an "open source is a cancer" stance to becoming a major open-source contributor shows how the industry has shifted. The decision enabled broader adoption of .NET and proved that open-sourcing can be a successful business strategy.
