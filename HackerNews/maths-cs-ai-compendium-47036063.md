# Summary

Henry Ndubuaku, with 7 years of AI/ML experience, has shared an open, unconventional textbook covering mathematics, computing, and artificial intelligence from the ground up. The compendium was originally personal notes filled with intuition-first, real-world context explanations that avoid hand-waving.

The material has proven effective: friends who used these notes to prepare for interviews at DeepMind, OpenAI, and Nvidia all succeeded in getting hired and perform well in their roles. The content targets curious practitioners seeking deeper understanding rather than just exam/interview survival.

Currently available chapters cover: Vectors (spaces, norms, metrics, dot/cross products, basis, duality), Matrices (properties, operations, decompositions like LU, QR, SVD), Calculus (derivatives, integrals, multivariate, optimization), Statistics (sampling, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals), Probability (distributions, Bayesian methods, information theory), and Machine Learning (classical ML, deep learning, reinforcement learning, distributed training).

Upcoming chapters will cover: Computational Linguistics (NLP, transformers, MoE), Computer Vision (CNNs, diffusion, SLAM), Audio & Speech (ASR, TTS, diarization), Multimodal Learning, Autonomous Systems (robot learning, VLAs), Computing & OS, Data Structures & Algorithms, SIMD & GPU Programming, Inference optimization, and Henry's research findings.

## Key Takeaways
- Open textbook with intuition-first approach to math, CS, and AI
- Battle-tested: used successfully for DeepMind/OpenAI/Nvidia interview prep
- 6 chapters currently available covering fundamentals through ML
- 11 more chapters planned covering advanced topics
- Targets practitioners wanting deep understanding, not exam memorization
