# Summary

A Hacker News user poses a thought-provoking question about the post-AI-bubble landscape. If massive compute costs never translate into profits and VC funding dries up, what happens to the tools developers have come to rely on daily?

The author notes that many developers now use Copilot, Claude, or ChatGPT daily for coding and documentation. If subsidized cheap access disappears because companies can no longer absorb losses, the question becomes whether these tools simply vanish or become prohibitively expensive. Would developers or companies pay $1,000/month if that reflected actual operating costs?

The post specifically seeks perspective from those who experienced the 2000 dotcom crash or 2008 financial crisis. The core question: does a post-bubble world mean abandoning the technology entirely, or transitioning to expensive enterprise-only solutions?

This discussion reflects growing uncertainty in the developer community about the sustainability of current AI pricing models. Many AI services are widely understood to be operating at significant losses to gain market share, raising legitimate questions about long-term viability.

## Key Takeaways
- Developers have become reliant on AI tools that may be unsustainably subsidized
- Current AI pricing likely doesn't reflect true operating costs
- Uncertainty about whether tools would survive or become enterprise-only
- Parallels drawn to previous tech bubbles (2000, 2008)
- Community seeking perspective from those who lived through previous cycles
