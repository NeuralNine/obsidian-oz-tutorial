# Summary

MicroGPT is an educational tool inspired by Karpathy's project of the same name. It's a tiny GPT/LLM/neural network with approximately 4,000 parameters that learns to generate names, running entirely in the browser.

The key educational value is visualization: users can watch activations pass through the network in real-time and click on different components to get explanations of what they do. This makes the typically opaque workings of transformer-based language models more accessible and understandable.

By drastically reducing the scale (4,000 parameters vs billions in production models), the project makes it possible to observe and interact with every part of the model architecture. The name generation task provides a simple, understandable goal that demonstrates the core capabilities of autoregressive language modeling.

This follows in the tradition of educational projects that make complex ML concepts tangible through interactive visualization, helping developers and students build intuition about how these systems actually work under the hood.

## Key Takeaways
- Browser-based GPT with ~4,000 parameters for educational purposes
- Real-time visualization of activations flowing through the network
- Interactive: click components to get explanations
- Demonstrates language model concepts at human-comprehensible scale
- Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's educational ML projects
