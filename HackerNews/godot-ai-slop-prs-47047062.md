# Summary

Rémi Verschelde (akien), co-founder of the Godot game engine project, posted on Bluesky expressing that AI-generated pull requests have become draining and demoralizing for open source maintainers. This reflects a growing concern in the open source community about the quality and volume of AI-assisted code contributions.

The post highlights the burden that AI "slop" PRs place on volunteer maintainers who must review and often reject low-quality, AI-generated submissions. This issue has become increasingly prominent as AI coding tools have made it easier to generate pull requests without proper understanding of the codebase or contribution guidelines.

This sentiment echoes broader concerns in the open source community about the sustainability of maintaining projects when volunteers must spend significant time filtering through AI-generated noise rather than focusing on meaningful contributions.
