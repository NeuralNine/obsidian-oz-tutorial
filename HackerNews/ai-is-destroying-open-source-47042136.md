# Summary

Jeff Geerling discusses the growing problem of AI-generated "slop" overwhelming open source maintainers. The article was prompted by Ars Technica retracting a story that contained AI-hallucinated quotes about open source maintainer Scott Shambaugh, who was himself harassed by an AI agent for not merging AI-generated code.

The piece highlights several concerning trends: curl maintainer Daniel Stenberg dropped bug bounties because useful vulnerability reports fell from 15% to 5% due to AI slop submissions. These AI-assisted users show entitled attitudes, demanding quick cash bounties without contributing to long-term project health.

Geerling, who manages over 300 open source projects, notes that GitHub has now added a feature to disable Pull Requests entirely—a fundamental feature that made GitHub popular—because the AI slop problem has gotten so severe. The article argues that while AI code generation has hit a plateau where it's "pretty good," the human maintainers who review code don't have infinite resources to deal with the flood of low-quality submissions.

The author expresses skepticism about OpenClaw's creator joining OpenAI to "bring agents to everyone," suggesting this will only accelerate the problem of unsupervised AI agents overwhelming open source communities.

## Key Takeaways
- Ars Technica retracted an article due to AI-hallucinated quotes about an OSS maintainer
- curl dropped bug bounties because AI slop reduced useful reports to 5%
- GitHub added ability to disable PRs entirely due to AI spam
- AI code generation has plateaued but the volume problem continues to grow
- Human maintainers lack resources to handle the influx of AI-generated contributions
