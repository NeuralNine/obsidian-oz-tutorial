# Summary

Published in Nature Communications, this research investigates how humans achieve one-shot perceptual learning—the ability to drastically and permanently alter visual perception from a single viewing experience. This phenomenon, famously illustrated by the Dalmatian Dog picture and Mooney images, represents one of the brain's most impressive capabilities that remains a major challenge for modern AI to replicate.

The researchers combined psychophysics, 7T fMRI, and intracranial recordings to identify the high-level visual cortex as the neural substrate where plasticity supports one-shot perceptual learning. This finding pinpoints where in the brain these rapid learning events occur, addressing a longstanding mystery in neuroscience.

The team developed a deep neural network model incorporating top-down feedback into a vision transformer architecture that successfully recapitulates and predicts human behavior in these learning tasks. Remarkably, the prior knowledge learned by this model closely resembles the neural code found in human high-level visual cortex, suggesting the model captures something fundamental about biological learning mechanisms.

This work bridges neuroscience and AI research, offering insights that could inform the development of more sample-efficient machine learning systems capable of rapid generalization from minimal examples—a capability that current deep learning approaches notably lack.

## Key Takeaways

- Identifies high-level visual cortex as the site of one-shot perceptual learning
- Combines 7T fMRI and intracranial recordings with computational modeling
- Vision transformer with top-down feedback replicates human learning behavior
- Model's learned representations match human neural codes
