# Summary

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced on Twitter/X that Codex weekly active users have tripled since the beginning of 2026. This significant growth metric highlights the rapid adoption of AI coding assistants in the developer community.

Codex, OpenAI's AI-powered coding assistant, has been competing in the increasingly crowded AI code generation market against tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and various other AI-powered development environments. The tripling of users in approximately six weeks suggests strong momentum and market validation for OpenAI's coding tools.

This growth comes amid broader trends in AI-assisted software development, where developers are increasingly integrating LLM-powered tools into their workflows for code completion, generation, debugging, and documentation. The announcement underscores OpenAI's continued focus on developer tools as a key product category.
