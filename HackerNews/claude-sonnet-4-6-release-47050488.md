# Summary

Anthropic has released Claude Sonnet 4.6, their most capable Sonnet model to date. The release represents a full upgrade across coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, agent planning, knowledge work, and design capabilities. Notably, Sonnet 4.6 features a 1M token context window in beta.

The model is now the default for Free and Pro plans on claude.ai and Claude Cowork. Pricing remains the same as Sonnet 4.5 at $3/$15 per million tokens. Early access developers have shown strong preference for Sonnet 4.6 over its predecessor, often preferring it even to the larger Claude Opus 4.5 model for certain tasks.

A major highlight is the improvement in computer use capabilities. Anthropic was the first to introduce general-purpose computer-using AI in October 2024. On the OSWorld benchmark—which tests tasks across real software like Chrome, LibreOffice, and VS Code—Sonnet models have shown steady gains over sixteen months. Early users are seeing human-level capability in tasks like navigating complex spreadsheets and multi-step web forms.

Safety evaluations showed Sonnet 4.6 to be as safe or safer than previous Claude models, with researchers noting the model has "a broadly warm, honest, prosocial, and at times funny character" with strong safety behaviors and no signs of major concerns.

## Key Takeaways

- Claude Sonnet 4.6 is Anthropic's most capable Sonnet model with major improvements across all skill areas
