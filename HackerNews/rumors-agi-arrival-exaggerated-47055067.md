# Summary

Gary Marcus, Walter Quattrociocchi, and Valerio Capraro published a response in Nature challenging recent claims that AGI has already been achieved. The authors argue that such claims confuse high benchmark performance with the genuine flexibility and generalization that historically defined artificial general intelligence.

The essay traces how the definition of AGI has been weakened over time. The original definition, formalized by Legg and Hutter (2007), characterized intelligence as an agent's ability to achieve goals across a broad range of environments with robustness and generalization at its core. Related definitions by Goertzel (2014) emphasized open-ended learning and domain-general problem-solving. However, recent attempts have redefined AGI in terms of benchmark performance or economic utility—criteria the authors consider insufficient.

The core argument is that current LLM systems represent "increasingly sophisticated statistical approximations" rather than true intelligence. Task-level performance on benchmarks, even when impressive, does not constitute evidence of general intelligence. The authors point to continued "AI fails" as evidence that systems lack the reliability and flexibility central to original AGI definitions.

The piece responds specifically to claims made in a Nature essay and argues that redefining AGI to match what current systems can do represents a "fundamental conceptual error" rather than genuine progress toward machine intelligence.

## Key Takeaways

- Claims of achieved AGI conflate benchmark performance with genuine intelligence
- Original AGI definitions emphasized robustness, flexibility, and generalization
- Recent redefinitions weaken AGI to mean broad benchmark performance or economic usefulness
- Current LLMs are statistical approximations, not general intelligences
- Published as a formal response in Nature to counter AGI achievement claims
