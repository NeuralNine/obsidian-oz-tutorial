# Summary

A software developer reflects on their changing perspective about AI while on vacation before starting a new job. Unlike the Luddites or fears about ATMs eliminating bank tellers, the author finds AI concerns uniquely troubling because AI company executives themselves are predicting job losses.

The author notes a bizarre marketing paradox: AI CEOs like Microsoft's AI head and Sam Altman publicly state that AI will eliminate entire job categories and create a "permanent underclass," which seems antithetical to promoting their products. The author suggests this messaging might target wealthy investors rather than general consumers.

If AI leaders genuinely believe these predictions, the author argues they should lobby for legislation with trigger conditions—laws that automatically activate (like UBI or retraining programs) when unemployment rises while GDP grows. The absence of such proposals suggests either indifference to consequences, lack of imagination, or less confidence in AI capabilities than publicly stated.

The piece also discusses immediate AI downsides, including students blatantly submitting ChatGPT-generated assignments without even removing the "would you like me to also do (related thing)?" prompts. Despite these concerns, the author acknowledges using AI tools like Gemini daily for various tasks.

## Key Takeaways
- AI executives' doom predictions create a unique situation where technology makers warn against their own products
- The author proposes "trigger condition" legislation as a rational response if AI job displacement is truly imminent
- Current AI issues include academic integrity problems with obvious ChatGPT submissions
- Historical comparisons to Luddites and ATM fears may not apply to AI
- The messaging disconnect suggests either cynicism, lack of imagination, or less confidence than stated
