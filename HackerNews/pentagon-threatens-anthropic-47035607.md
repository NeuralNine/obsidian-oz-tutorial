# Summary

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is threatening to cut business ties with Anthropic and designate the company a "supply chain risk"—a penalty typically reserved for foreign adversaries. This would force any company doing business with the U.S. military to certify they don't use Claude in their workflows.

Anthropic's Claude is currently the only AI model available in the military's classified systems and was used during the Maduro raid in January. The dispute centers on usage terms: Anthropic wants to ensure its tools aren't used for mass surveillance of Americans or developing weapons that fire without human involvement. The Pentagon is demanding "all lawful purposes" usage rights.

The contentious negotiations have lasted months. While Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei is described as a "pragmatist" willing to loosen current terms, the company maintains certain red lines. The Pentagon claims Anthropic's restrictions create unworkable "gray areas."

The threatened contract cancellation is worth up to $200 million—a small fraction of Anthropic's $14 billion annual revenue. However, the "supply chain risk" designation would have broader implications, as eight of the ten biggest U.S. companies reportedly use Claude.

This situation sets the tone for Pentagon negotiations with OpenAI, Google, and xAI, all of which have agreed to remove safeguards for unclassified military use but haven't yet committed to classified work.

## Key Takeaways
- Claude is the only AI currently deployed on military classified systems
- Anthropic wants to prevent mass civilian surveillance and autonomous weapons
- Pentagon demanding "all lawful purposes" usage without restrictions
- Supply chain risk designation would affect major companies using Claude
- Other AI labs (OpenAI, Google, xAI) watching these negotiations closely
