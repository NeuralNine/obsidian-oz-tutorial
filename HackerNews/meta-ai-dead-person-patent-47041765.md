# Summary

Meta has been granted a patent (filed in 2023, granted December 2025) describing an AI system capable of simulating a user's activity on social media, including continuing to post after their death. The system would use a large language model to replicate a person's online behavior using their past data - posts, comments, chats, voice messages, likes, and other interactions.

According to the patent, the model "may be used for simulating the user when the user is absent from the social networking system," including cases where the person has died. The filing notes the impact is "much more severe and permanent" if the user has died and cannot return to the platform. The patent also references advanced possibilities including technology that could simulate audio or video calls using the reconstructed persona.

Despite the implications, a Meta spokesperson stated the company has "no plans to move forward with this example," explaining that patents are often filed to protect concepts that may never be developed. However, in a 2023 interview with Lex Fridman, Mark Zuckerberg said there "may be ways" for AI systems to help people interact with memories of loved ones, suggesting Meta will eventually "have the capacity" to create AI replicas of individuals - though he emphasized it should require consent.

Similar tools from startups have already sparked debate, with apps letting users create interactive digital avatars of deceased relatives, drawing comparisons to Black Mirror scenarios.

## Key Takeaways

- System uses LLM trained on user's posts, chats, voice messages, interactions
- Could also simulate audio/video calls using reconstructed persona
- Meta says no current plans to implement but patent protects the concept
- Zuckerberg previously hinted at AI replicas of deceased loved ones
