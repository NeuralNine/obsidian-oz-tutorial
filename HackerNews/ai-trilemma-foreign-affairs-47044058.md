# Summary

Foreign Affairs article by Sebastian Elbaum and Sebastian Mallaby examining the fundamental tradeoffs in AI governance. They identify three policy categories: national security (military/intelligence AI), economic security (business competitiveness), and societal security (safety, job protection, existential risk mitigation). The core argument is that pursuing all three objectives simultaneously is impossible - creating an AI policy "trilemma."

Three scenarios illustrate the tradeoffs: (1) Prioritizing national and economic security (Trump administration stance) means maximizing AI investment but compromising societal safety through slower rollouts. (2) Prioritizing national and societal security would mean treating AI like nuclear technology - siloing it in military/energy while restricting public use, but crippling commercial competitiveness. (3) Prioritizing economic and societal security ("responsible innovation") encourages development with rigorous safety requirements, but incautious rivals may gain military advantage.

The authors critique the "singularity" mental model that has distorted policy discussions, arguing that if superintelligence is imminent, only racing to reach it safely matters. This perspective has justified export controls on AI chips to China, with proponents arguing short-term competitive advantage matters more than long-term consequences.

The safety push of 2023-24 fizzled partly due to its overwhelming breadth - covering job displacement, deepfakes, copyright, environmental costs, and existential risk simultaneously. The authors argue proponents must pick priorities and develop workable policies like a "risk tax" on AI labs.

## Key Takeaways

- AI policy faces impossible trilemma: national, economic, and societal security
- Cannot maximize all three objectives simultaneously
- "Singularity" mental model has distorted policy discussions
- 2023-24 safety push failed due to overly broad, unfocused agenda
- Propose "risk tax" on AI labs and national data repository for oversight
