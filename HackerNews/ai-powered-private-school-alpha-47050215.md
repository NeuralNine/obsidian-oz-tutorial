# Summary

404 Media has published an investigative report on Alpha School, an AI-powered private school that has received praise from both media outlets and the Trump administration. However, leaked documents reveal significant problems with the school's AI-driven educational approach.

According to the leaked documents, Alpha School's AI system is generating faulty lessons that internal assessments describe as sometimes doing "more harm than good." The investigation raises serious concerns about using students as test subjects for unproven AI educational technology.

The report highlights the growing tension between the promise of AI-personalized education and the reality of deploying immature technology in high-stakes educational settings. Critics argue that students—particularly those in K-12 education—should not be subjected to experimental AI systems without proper validation and safeguards.

The investigation comes amid broader debates about the appropriate pace of AI adoption in education, and whether commercial interests are being prioritized over student welfare. The documents suggest that behind the school's polished public image, significant technical and pedagogical challenges remain unresolved.
