# Summary

Google has released a major upgrade to Gemini 3 Deep Think, their specialized reasoning mode designed to push the frontiers of intelligence for science, research, and engineering challenges. The model was developed in partnership with scientists and researchers to tackle problems that lack clear guardrails or single correct solutions, particularly when data is messy or incomplete.

Deep Think has achieved state-of-the-art results across rigorous benchmarks: 48.4% on Humanity's Last Exam (without tools), 84.6% on ARC-AGI-2 (verified by ARC Prize Foundation), an Elo of 3455 on Codeforces competitive programming, and gold-medal level performance on the International Math Olympiad 2025. It also demonstrates gold medal-level results on written sections of the 2025 International Physics and Chemistry Olympiads.

Early testers have used Deep Think for reviewing highly technical mathematics papers (identifying subtle logical flaws missed by peer review), optimizing crystal growth fabrication methods at Duke University, and accelerating physical component design at Google. The model can turn sketches into 3D-printable realities by analyzing drawings and generating printable files.

Deep Think is now available to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the Gemini app, with API access available through an early access program for researchers, engineers, and enterprises.
