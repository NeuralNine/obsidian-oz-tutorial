# Summary

Peter Steinberger, creator of OpenClaw, announces he's joining OpenAI to work on bringing AI agents to everyone. OpenClaw, his open-source AI agent project that has taken the internet by storm, will be moved to a foundation to remain open and independent.

Steinberger explains his motivation: after his "playground project" created unexpected waves, he received countless offers from investors and companies. However, he's a builder at heart who already spent 13 years building a company before, and his real goal is to change the world—not build another large company. He believes teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest path to bringing AI agents to everyone.

His next mission is to build an agent that "even my mum can use," which requires broad changes in safety considerations and access to the latest models and research. OpenAI has committed to sponsoring OpenClaw and enabling Steinberger to dedicate time to the project.

The community around OpenClaw will continue through its new foundation structure, supporting multiple models and companies while maintaining its focus on open source and user data ownership.
