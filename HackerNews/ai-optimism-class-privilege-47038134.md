# Summary

Josh Collinsworth argues that being enthusiastic about AI "as it exists currently" requires a certain degree of privilege. The post crystallizes around the observation that AI optimists generally see themselves as benefiting from AI, not as those it might cost.

The author recounts testing a GitHub profile "roast" tool that generated surprisingly mean, personal insults - and realizing with horror that this is a tool that will be weaponized against his children through deepfakes, highly personalized bullying, and targeted harassment at scales previously impossible. "We're racing to build the perfect bullying tool."

The central thesis: to be an AI optimist, you likely need to feel secure in your career position. You probably aren't worried about job displacement, aren't staring down the dire job market, and believe you're high enough in the org chart or have established enough reputation to be safe. "Maybe this is all a lot easier to be optimistic about with the right charts and graphs in front of you."

The author acknowledges using AI occasionally for code completion, reference images, and ideating, but remains deeply skeptical of net productivity claims especially for frontend development. He's "decidedly on the pessimist side" when looking at AI's current impact. He compares AI optimism to religion - "fervent believers, prophecies from prominent figures to be taken on faith, and a central object of worship which can at all times be offered as The Answer."

## Key Takeaways

- AI optimism correlates with privilege and career security
- Optimists see themselves as beneficiaries, not those displaced
- AI tools enable unprecedented scale of personalized harassment
- Skeptical of AI productivity claims especially for frontend code
- Describes AI optimism as having religious characteristics
