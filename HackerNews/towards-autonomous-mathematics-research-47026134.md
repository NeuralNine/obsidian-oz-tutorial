# Summary

Google DeepMind introduces Aletheia, a math research agent that iteratively generates, verifies, and revises mathematical proofs end-to-end in natural language. The system is powered by an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think and represents a significant step beyond competition-level problem-solving toward professional mathematics research.

Aletheia demonstrates several key capabilities including navigating vast mathematical literature, constructing long-horizon proofs, and intensive tool use. The system has achieved notable milestones: generating a research paper on arithmetic geometry eigenweights without human intervention, enabling human-AI collaboration on proving bounds for independent sets, and autonomously solving four open questions from Bloom's Erdos Conjectures database out of 700 evaluated problems.

The paper proposes novel frameworks for evaluating AI-assisted mathematics, including quantifying levels of autonomy and novelty, as well as "human-AI interaction cards" for transparency. The authors share all prompts and model outputs publicly to help the research community understand AI's evolving role in mathematics.

## Key Takeaways

- Aletheia extends AI capabilities from Olympiad-level math to PhD-level exercises and open research problems
- First demonstration of a fully autonomous AI-generated research paper in arithmetic geometry
- Novel inference-time scaling law that works beyond competition mathematics
- Proposes standardized metrics for measuring AI autonomy and novelty in research
- Solved 4 previously open mathematical conjectures from the Erdos database
