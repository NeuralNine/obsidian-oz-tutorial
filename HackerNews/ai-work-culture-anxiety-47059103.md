# Summary

San Francisco's AI startups are pushing workers into extreme work schedules, with 12-hour days and 6-7 day work weeks becoming normalized. The article profiles multiple founders and employees who describe working conditions where founders live in office apartments working 9am to 3am, and cafes on Sundays are filled with people coding.

The intensity stems from multiple anxieties: fear of job displacement by AI, rapid technological change that makes weekends off feel like falling behind, and the need to build portfolios as entry-level jobs disappear. Job postings for entry-level tech positions have dropped by a third since 2022, while senior roles requiring 5+ years experience have risen.

Executive coaches note a shift from companies asking about employee wellbeing to focusing on "change, disruption and uncertainty." Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have publicly predicted AI replacing junior engineers. Tech companies laid off about 250,000 workers globally in 2025, often citing AI as a factor.

Stanford researchers found "substantial declines in employment for early-career workers" in AI-exposed industries. Anthropic's CEO suggested AI could eliminate about half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within five years. The IMF predicted 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be eliminated or transformed.

## Key Takeaways

- AI startup workers regularly work 12+ hour days, 6-7 days per week
- Entry-level tech job postings down 33% since 2022
- 250,000 tech layoffs in 2025 with AI often cited as factor
- Fear of missing rapid AI developments drives constant work pressure
- Economists warn AI startup culture may preview broader labor market disruption
