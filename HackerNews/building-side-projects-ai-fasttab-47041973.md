# Summary

This article by Loris Bognanni describes the experience of building FastTab, a custom Plasma task switcher, using AI-assisted development despite not knowing the Zig programming language. The author's motivation was simple: the existing task switcher was "a second too slow," and they wanted to fix it for themselves.

The piece explores the concept of "building for an audience of one" - creating software purely for personal use without worrying about broader adoption. With AI coding assistants, the barrier to building custom tools has dropped significantly, making it feasible to build niche solutions that only benefit a single user.

The author details their workflow using AI tools to learn Zig on the fly while building the application, demonstrating how AI-assisted development can enable rapid prototyping in unfamiliar languages and frameworks. This represents a shift in how developers approach side projects, with AI filling knowledge gaps in real-time.

## Key Takeaways

- AI tools enable building in unfamiliar languages without prior expertise
- "Audience of one" philosophy: build for yourself, ship for yourself
- Lower barrier to entry for custom tool development
- AI-assisted coding changes the economics of niche software projects
- Demonstrates practical workflow for AI-assisted development
