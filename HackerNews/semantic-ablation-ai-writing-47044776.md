# Summary

The Register introduces and codifies the term "semantic ablation" - the algorithmic erosion of high-entropy information in AI-generated text. Just as "hallucination" describes additive errors (AI seeing what isn't there), semantic ablation describes the subtractive bias where AI destroys what actually exists in human writing.

The article explains that during AI "refinement," models gravitate toward the center of the Gaussian distribution, discarding rare, precise, and complex tokens to maximize statistical probability. Developers have exacerbated this through aggressive safety and helpfulness tuning, which penalizes unconventional linguistic friction. The result is a "JPEG of thought" - visually coherent but stripped of original data density.

The process performs a systematic lobotomy across three stages: metaphoric cleansing (replacing unconventional metaphors with safe clichés), lexical flattening (sacrificing domain-specific jargon for generic synonyms), and structural collapse (forcing complex non-linear reasoning into predictable low-perplexity templates).

The author warns that by accepting ablated outputs, society is building a world on hollowed-out syntax, witnessing a "race to the middle" where human thought complexity is sacrificed for algorithmic smoothness. The concern is that if this pattern continues unchallenged, we will soon forget what substance even looks like.

## Key Takeaways

- "Semantic ablation" = algorithmic erosion of high-entropy information in AI text
- AI "polishing" systematically replaces unique insights with generic token sequences
- Three-stage process: metaphoric cleansing, lexical flattening, structural collapse
- Result is "JPEG of thought" - coherent but hollowed of semantic density
- Warns of civilizational "race to the middle" in human expression
