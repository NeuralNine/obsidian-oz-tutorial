# Summary

Epoch AI examines a critical question for the AI industry: will inference costs remain a significant burden, or will they decline rapidly enough to enable widespread AI deployment? The analysis looks at historical trends, hardware improvements, and algorithmic advances to project future cost trajectories.

The piece explores the economics of running AI models at scale, noting that while training costs receive significant attention, inference costs—running models to produce outputs—often dominate total cost of ownership for deployed systems. A model might cost millions to train but billions to run at scale over its lifetime.

Several factors could reduce inference costs: continued hardware improvements following Moore's Law-like trends, specialized AI accelerators, algorithmic optimizations like quantization and distillation, and architectural improvements that reduce computational requirements per token. However, the analysis notes that demand for AI capabilities may grow faster than cost reductions, keeping the burden persistent.

The study also examines the relationship between model capability and inference cost. More capable models typically require more computation, creating tension between the desire for better AI and cost constraints. This dynamic affects decisions about model deployment, pricing strategies, and which applications become economically viable.

Understanding inference cost trajectories has major implications for AI companies' business models, the democratization of AI access, and which applications will prove economically sustainable.

## Key Takeaways
- Inference costs often dominate total AI deployment costs over model lifetime
- Hardware advances and algorithmic optimizations are driving costs down
- Demand growth may outpace cost reductions, keeping burden persistent
- More capable models typically require more computation
- Cost trajectories affect AI business models and application viability
