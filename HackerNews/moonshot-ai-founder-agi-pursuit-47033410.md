# Summary

This profile examines Zhilin Yang, founder and CEO of Moonshot AI (the company behind Kimi), and the company's position in China's AI landscape. Yang describes his team as "stubborn AGI purists" focused on the future vision rather than short-term profit—a contrast to big tech players.

Moonshot AI gained significant attention with the release of Kimi K2, China's first open-source trillion-parameter model. Within 48 hours of release, Kimi's website visits surged by 3.6 billion, Hugging Face downloads exceeded 100,000, and it topped global API call rankings on OpenRouter, surpassing Grok-4. The model reportedly outperforms DeepSeek V3 and Claude models in coding, agent tasks, and tool integration.

Yang's background is impressive: he graduated first in his class from Tsinghua University's CS department, completed his PhD at Carnegie Mellon in under four years, collaborated with multiple Turing Award winners, and worked at Facebook AI Research and Google Brain before founding Moonshot AI in 2023. The company has been backed by Alibaba, Tencent, and Sequoia China, reaching a ~$3.3 billion valuation in late 2024.

The company name reflects their mission: "Just like AGI, you usually only see the illuminated side of the moon, but the dark side remains mysterious. It's challenging, yet full of potential."

## Key Takeaways

- Kimi K2 is China's first open-source trillion-parameter model, outperforming DeepSeek V3 and Claude on benchmarks
- Founder Zhilin Yang has elite academic credentials (Tsinghua, CMU) and industry experience (FAIR, Google Brain)
- Company valued at ~$3.3B backed by Alibaba, Tencent, and Sequoia China
- Yang positions Moonshot as AGI-focused rather than product/profit-focused
- Kimi K2 topped global API usage rankings within 48 hours of release
