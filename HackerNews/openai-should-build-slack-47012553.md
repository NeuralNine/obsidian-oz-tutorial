# Summary

The article argues that OpenAI should build its own Slack competitor as a strategic move. Following Sam Altman's town hall where he asked what OpenAI should build next, the author proposes that building a Slack alternative fits Altman's criteria: it's hard for others to pull off without OpenAI's clout, would be well-received by the tech community, and is a natural progression of ChatGPT for enterprise and coding.

The case against Slack: it was acquired by Salesforce for $27.7B in 2021, has increased prices, struggles to introduce compelling AI features (Slack AI is described as occasionally useful but impossible to discover/learn/personalize), and faces constant outages. NPS feels low despite ubiquitous adoption in tech organizations. Developers complain about API costs and permissions.

The strategic advantages for OpenAI include: layering organization social graphs and work graphs onto ChatGPT, creating network effects that make switching harder, building the coding agent interface they want (multiplayer collaboration with AI agents), and competing with Anthropic's more cohesive desktop strategy (one app for Chat, Cowork, and Claude Code). The author notes that OpenAI even hired former Slack CEO Denise Dresser in December.

The article also covers AI news including MiniMax M2.5 open-sourcing and GLM-5 release, both positioned as strong open-source options for agent-native applications.

## Key Takeaways

- OpenAI should build Slack competitor for strategic enterprise moat
- Slack has struggled with AI features and faces persistent complaints
- Could enable multiplayer human-AI agent collaboration interfaces
- Network effects would make it harder to switch from ChatGPT ecosystem
- OpenAI hired former Slack CEO Denise Dresser in December
