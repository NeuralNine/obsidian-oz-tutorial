# Summary

The European Parliament has disabled AI features on lawmakers' corporate devices including tablets, citing data security concerns. The IT department could not guarantee that confidential data wouldn't be sent to cloud services when using AI assistants for tasks like email summarization.

Staff were notified that until the full extent of data sharing with service providers is clarified, AI features will remain disabled. The temporary ban reflects broader concerns about AI services and data privacy—studies have shown employees regularly leak company secrets via AI assistants.

The ban does not affect day-to-day tools like calendar applications. The guidance also advises against granting third-party AI apps broad access to data. This comes from the same Parliament that enacted the world's first AI-specific legislation addressing perceived technology risks—the AI Act.

## Key Takeaways

- EU Parliament disables AI features on lawmakers' devices over data security concerns
- Cloud-based AI processing raises confidentiality issues for government work
- Temporary ban until data sharing practices can be fully assessed
- Same institution that passed landmark AI Act regulation
- Reflects growing enterprise concern about AI data handling
